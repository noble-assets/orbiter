# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Common Commands

### Building

- `make build` - Build the simd binary (builds in simapp directory)
- `make all` - Full build pipeline: protobuf generation, formatting, linting, license check, unit
  tests, and build

### Testing

- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests for keeper, controllers, and types packages
- `make test-unit-viz` - Run unit tests with coverage visualization and HTML reports
- `make test-e2e` - Run end-to-end tests (requires Docker image build first)
- `go test -v ./keeper/...` - Run tests for a specific package
- `go test -v ./controllers/...` - Run controller tests
- `go test -v ./types/...` - Run type tests

### Code Quality

- `make format` - Run Go formatters using golangci-lint
- `make lint` - Run linter using golangci-lint configuration
- `make license` - Add license headers to Go files

### Protobuf

- `make proto-all` - Full protobuf pipeline (format, lint, generate)
- `make proto-gen` - Generate Go code from protobuf files using Docker
- `make proto-format` - Format protobuf files using buf
- `make proto-lint` - Lint protobuf files using buf

### Local Development

- `make local-image` - Build local Docker image using heighliner
- `./local.sh` - Local development script

## Architecture

### Core Components

The Orbiter module is a Cosmos SDK module that implements cross-chain functionality using a
component-based architecture:

- **Keeper** (`keeper/keeper.go`): Main module keeper managing four core components
- **ActionComponent**: Handles pre-execution actions (like fee payments)
- **OrbitComponent**: Manages cross-chain forwarding operations
- **DispatcherComponent**: Orchestrates payload processing and execution
- **AdapterComponent**: Interfaces with external protocols

### Key Directories

- `keeper/components/` - Core business logic components
- `controllers/` - Protocol-specific implementations (actions, orbits)
- `types/` - Type definitions, interfaces, and protobuf-generated code
- `types/interfaces/` - Interface definitions for components and controllers
- `entrypoint/` - IBC middleware integration
- `proto/` - Protobuf schema definitions
- `e2e/` - End-to-end integration tests
- `simapp/` - Simulation application for testing
- `testutil/` - Test utilities and mocks

### Supported Protocols

- **CCTP (Circle Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol)** - Production ready
- **IBC** - In development (TODO)
- **Hyperlane** - In development (TODO)

### Actions & Orbits

- **Actions**: Pre-execution operations (currently supports fee payments)
- **Orbits**: Cross-chain forwarding operations via bridge protocols
- Both use a controller pattern with routers for extensibility

### Payload Structure

The module processes JSON payloads containing:

- `pre_actions[]` - List of actions to execute before forwarding
- `orbit` - Forwarding operation specification with protocol-specific attributes

## Integration Notes

- IBC memo field integration for payload delivery
- Protobuf-based type system with interface registry
- Component-based architecture allows easy extension of protocols
- Comprehensive test coverage with unit and e2e tests

## Development

- Uses Go 1.24.4
- Cosmos SDK v0.50.13
- IBC-Go v8.3.2
- Circle CCTP integration
- Buf for protobuf tooling
- Docker required for protobuf generation and e2e tests
