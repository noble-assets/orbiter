## Introduction

The Orbiter module is based on the 3-steps logic to abstract cross-chain transfers which uses Noble
as an intermediary step. The bridge implementation abstraction, is achieved through an initial
adaptation phase of the cross-chain transfer and payload.

Every bridge solution is designed differently, and specifically, not all solutions allow to perform
a transfer with attached metadata.
